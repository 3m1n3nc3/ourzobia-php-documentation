## Welcome to Ourzobia PHP

Ourzobia PHP - Social Peer to Peer Donation System is the most advanced Peer to Peer Donation system currently available in the market. It is designed to accommodate millions of users with the sole aim of creating a platform for Social Donations, somewhat like the usual weekly Esusu contributions done in certain countries around the world.

Built upon the latest version of the Codeigniter PHP framework, this system enables you to run and manage your own Social Peer to Peer Donation scheme with Cryptocurrency support and without limitations.
Ourzobia PHP has a built in Social Network called PLAYGROUND, purposely designed to alienate the use of conventional social media accounts alongside your website and to eliminate the fear of criminal actors that have become a plague on the social networking handles of so many similar concepts.
Installation and management has been so simplified that you might not have any other real job to do after installation, other than monitoring. Almost all major processes and actions have been automated.
