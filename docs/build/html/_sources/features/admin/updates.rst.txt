System updates are delivered in form of zipped archives and can be installed in a very simple and elegant way. Once you have a working installation of Ourzobia PHP on your server, you do not need access to your servers management panel in order to install future updates and themes. 

To install an update after downloading the archive, make sure you set your servers ``upload_max_filesize`` to a very high value, we recommend ``150M`` and above, log in to your Admin account and point your web browser to ``http://yourdomain.com/admin/updates`` where ``yourdomain.com`` is your actual domain name. 

Click on ``Upload Update File`` and wait for the upload to complete, then click on ``Install``. The process is automated and simple.
