**HubBoxx - Enterprise Hub and Web Product Manager** is a business hub or office space booking and web product validation and activation platform, that will help you protect your **PHP, NODE JS, ASP.net code scripts** and potentially anything that needs a web browser to run from unauthorized use and theft and also enables you manage and allow customers to make **online bookings** for your business hubs and rented office facilities.
