Generating Sitemaps
*******************

The system has been built with the ability to automatically generate sitemaps on single click, the most interesting part is that after generating sitemaps, the system automatically pings all major search engines to crawl your website, removing the procedure of you having to manually submit your sitemaps to them. To generate or update your sitemaps navigate to ``http://yourdomain.com/admin/configuration/sitemap`` where ``yourdomain.com`` is your actual domain name, on the ``Generate Sitemaps`` and your sitemaps are instantly generated, follow the same procedures for updating.
